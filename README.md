A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF CSS STYLING

The h1 contain the header of this project, we have a list of 5 colors (each list appears in its shade. i.e. “red” appears in red, and also have an image next to it representing an item in that color i.e. an image of a red car).

It was triplicated, we used In-line CSS in first styling, internal CSS in the second styling, and External CSS in the third styling.

Inline styles apply a style attribute with a CSS rule to a particular page element and are associated with a certain HTML tag. They are helpful for making quick and lasting modifications, although they are less flexible than external and internal stylesheets.

An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code.

A standalone .css file linked from a web page is referred to as an external stylesheet. You can apply rules to various web pages using external stylesheets. A single update in the stylesheet may be applied to all linked pages if you ever need to make significant changes to the look of your website, saving lots of time and effort.
